# Heart-Attack-Prediction-
📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes how various health factors—such as cholesterol levels, smoking, drinking, age, and medication—affect the chances of having a heart attack. Using a large dataset from Kaggle (372,976 records), I performed data cleaning, categorization, and visualization in Excel to derive meaningful insights.

📊 Dataset Information
Source: Kaggle - Heart Attack Prediction in the United States
Size: 372,976 rows
Key Variables: Cholesterol levels, blood pressure, age, smoking habits, alcohol consumption, medication usage, heart attack history
🛠 Tools & Techniques Used
Power Query: Data cleaning, removing duplicates
IF Functions: Categorizing cholesterol, age, blood pressure, and alcohol consumption into meaningful groups
Pivot Tables: Summarizing key insights
Visual Charts & Dynamic Dashboard: Presenting findings interactively
🔍 Key Findings
1️⃣ Cholesterol & Heart Attack Risk
Individuals with cholesterol levels above 250 are at a significantly higher risk of heart attacks.
Cholesterol was categorized as:
Good: Below 200
Borderline: 200-249
Dangerous: 250+



2️⃣ Age Factor in Heart Attacks
Middle-aged (30-55 years) and old-aged (55+ years) individuals have a higher risk of heart attacks.
Older adults (55+) are the most vulnerable group.
3️⃣ Impact of Smoking & Alcohol Consumption
Smokers and alcohol consumers have a significantly higher risk of heart attacks than non-smokers and non-drinkers.
4️⃣ Medication & Heart Attack Prevention
Individuals who took proper medication had a 60% lower risk of experiencing a heart attack.
